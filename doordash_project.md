### The Setup

The food delivery industry is rapidly growing and you've likely heard of it even if you haven't used it yet. The following data is made for the marketing team at DoorDash. I thInk its relatable to everyone and I hope you find it interesting to read!

**If you're curious about where you fit in the data, keep reading!** We've gathered some fascinating insights. We analyzed: 
- Age groups 
- Marital status 
- Presence of children 
- Popular months 
- High vs low income  
- Food categories. 

### The Project

DoorDash had requested an evaluation of the 6th campaign's success. They have also asked for ideas to improve sales on the platform.  
By using pivot tables, charts and some linear regression, sales can be analyzed and broken down into demographic groups. **We have put together some visuals to make the information easy to follow.**
- The results give a clear picture of who their loyal customers are.  
- Slower times of year show an opportunity for gift cards. 
- Meat is the most important category for generating revenue. 
- There is a correlation of 0.75 with higher income to the amount spent.
