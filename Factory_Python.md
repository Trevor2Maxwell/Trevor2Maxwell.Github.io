## Calling NBA enthusiasts ðŸ“ž

If you love to watch the NBA or you coach aspiring NBA players. Then you are in the right place! This dataset is rich with information for you to take your knowledge to the next level. 
I am no expert in regard to the NBA. However, I do like to challenge myself and learn new things. This project provided both. 
*The origin of the data can be found [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_totals.html )* <br><br>

### Introduction

The challenge for this project was to put together a data story. I felt **Tableau was the best program for creating beautiful visuals** and adding notes to organize a story.

**I will walk you through the data story.** 
I discover the insights as I was analyzing the data. You are welcome to visit the full interactive data story anytime on [Tableau public.](https://public.tableau.com/views/NBAProject_16890589596990/Story1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link )

There is also a bird eye view with [the dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/NBAProject_16890589596990/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link ) that I put together. If you wish to continue exploring. Then feel free to check that out.<br>

 ### Insights 
 
- **Teamwork leads to more points.** There is a strong relationship between assists and points. The more players pass to assist the more they also score.
- Each team has **2-3 superstars that are scoring the most points.**  
- **Age 25-30 is most common** and at the top of their game. The much younger players are scoring half as much. 
- **Point guards are getting the most assists** in general. Except for Nikola, he is on a whole other level. 
- The power forward seems to be very good at the 3pt shots. **The center position is the worst at the 3pt shot.**
