## Calling NBA enthusiasts ðŸ“ž

If you love to watch the NBA or you coach aspiring NBA players. Then you are in the right place! This dataset is rich with information for you to take your knowledge to the next level.

*The origin of the data can be found [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022_totals.html )* <br><br>

### Introduction

The challenge for this project was to put together a data story. I felt **Tableau was the best program for creating beautiful visuals** and adding notes to organize a story.

**I will walk you through the data story.** 
I discover the insights as I was analyzing the data. You are welcome to visit the full interactive data story anytime on [Tableau public.](https://public.tableau.com/views/NBAProject_16890589596990/Story1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link )

There is also a bird eye view with [the dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/NBAProject_16890589596990/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link ) that I put together. If you wish to continue exploring. Then feel free to check that out.<br>

 ### Insights

- Each team has 2-3 superstars that are scoring the most points.  
- Age 25-30 is most common and at the top of their game. The much younger players are scoring half as much. 
- Point guards are getting the most assists in general. Except for Nikola, he is on a whole other level.
