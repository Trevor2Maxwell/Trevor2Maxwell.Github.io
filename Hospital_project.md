# Drilling Down On IDA Loans.
 
## Background 

The data is a snapshot from the world bank for November 2022. We're going to be analyzing it. More specifically the IDA statement of credits and grants. **Then looking at helpful insights from the SQL inquiries.**

The origin of the data can be found [here](https://finances.worldbank.org/Loans-and-Credits/IDA-Statement-Of-Credits-and-Grants-Historical-Dat/tdwh-3krx)

The International Development Association (IDA) credits are public and publicly guaranteed debt extended by the World Bank Group. **IDA provides development credits, grants**, and guarantees to its **recipient member countries to help meet their development needs.** 

## The Data 

We started our journey by asking a few interesting questions!  
- What is the highest loan to the IDA? 
- Who has the most loans? 
- Which was the most recent to pay?<br>
