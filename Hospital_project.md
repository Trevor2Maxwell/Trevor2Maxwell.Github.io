# Streamline procedures & Maximize hospital capacity

## Introduction 

We analyzed data from 101,766 patients across a span of 10 years, gathered from 130 hospitals.

Did you know that the average cost of a hospital stay in the US is $2,873 per day? When patients stay longer than necessary, it can prevent new patients from receiving the care they need. That's why **we're exploring using ways to open up more beds** and reduce unnecessary costs for patients who could be recovering at home.
