# Streamline procedures & Maximize hospital capacity

## Introduction 

We analyzed data from 101,766 patients across a span of 10 years, gathered from 130 hospitals.

Did you know that the average cost of a hospital stay in the US is $2,873 per day? When patients stay longer than necessary, it can prevent new patients from receiving the care they need. That's why **we're exploring using ways to open up more beds** and reduce unnecessary costs for patients who could be recovering at home.

## Great Questions  

- What are six success stories of patients coming to the emergency? 
- Are Patients staying at the hospital less than a week on average?  
- What medical specialties are doing the most procedures? 
- Is there any special treatment for a certain race? 
- Does more lab procedures correlate to more days in the hospital? 
- Can we make a summary of patients with the most medication?
  
## Key Insights 

- There are success stories means we have examples to look into.  
 - The average stay overall is 4.40 days and would cost $12,641 if the patient was responsible for the full amount. 
 - Cardiology and Cardiology surgery are the most common procedures by far.  
 - From the data, all races are treated the same for lab procedures.  
 - In the vast majority of cases, more procedures equals more days in hospital.  
 - The summary shows even with 9 medications not always readmitted. 


## The Data 
**Creating room for incoming patients in hospitals is of utmost importance** and there are **two approaches** to achieve this goal.

1. Building more rooms and. Adding more beds.  
2. Promptly discharging patients. 

When it comes to patient care, efficiency is important, but it's equally important to ensure that patients aren't readmitted less than 30 days after being discharged. This requires a careful balance between prompt discharge and thorough follow-up care to prevent any unnecessary readmissions.

let's start things out with a positive note and look at six success stories that happened inside the emergency unit. <br>

Knowing specifically what contributed to making these success stories happen would be good data to collect. **You can imagine how much of an impact this has on opening up beds.** 

Trying to see if the avg stay in the hospital was less than 7 days is easiest with a histogram.
