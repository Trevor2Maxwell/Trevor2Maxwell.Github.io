# Streamline procedures & Maximize hospital capacity

## Introduction 

We analyzed data from 101,766 patients across a span of 10 years, gathered from 130 hospitals.

Did you know that the average cost of a hospital stay in the US is $2,873 per day? When patients stay longer than necessary, it can prevent new patients from receiving the care they need. That's why **we're exploring using ways to open up more beds** and reduce unnecessary costs for patients who could be recovering at home.

The International Development Association (IDA) credits are public and publicly guaranteed debt extended by the World Bank Group. **IDA provides development credits, grants**, and guarantees to its **recipient member countries to help meet their development needs.** 

## The Data 

We started our journey by asking a few interesting questions!  
- What is the highest loan to the IDA? 
- Who has the most loans? 
- Which was the most recent to pay?<br>
